Configure Teresa

Teresa cli. You can manage teams, users and create and deploy applications with
it.

Teresa CLI works by sending HTTP requests to Kubernetes clusters that have a
Teresa API server running. You can have multiple clusters configured on your
local box, one for each cloud provider or one for each environment or a mix
of those.

Teresa doesn't start using any cluster by it's own: you have to tell her which
one to use.

To set a cluster, eg.:

  $ teresa config set-cluster my_cluster_name -s https://mycluster.mydomain.com

To use that cluster:

  $ teresa config use-cluster my_cluster_name

From that point on, all the operations will be directed to that cluster. You can
view the whole configuration anytime by running:

  $ teresa config view

Usage:
  teresa [command]

Available Commands:
  app         Everything about apps
  config      Setup cluster servers and view config file
  create      Create team, user or application

  deploy      Deploy an app
  gen         Generate bash autocompletion script for Teresa cli
